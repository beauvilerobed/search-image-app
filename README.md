# Search-Image-App

This project is one-page app that uses a photo search API (Flickr api) via AJAX to search for images and display them.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Quick start

Make sure that you have Node.js installed.
Then:
```
git clone https://github.com/beauvilerobed/Search-Image-App.git
cd Search-Image-App
npm install
```

To get a Flickr API key for API_KEY variable check out: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html

At this point you can run:
```
npm start
``` 
See the example app at `http://localhost:3000`.

Now you're ready to rumble!
